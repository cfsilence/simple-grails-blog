# Simple Grails Blog

An ultra simple blog written with Grails 3.2.4.  You can create users and write blog posts and tag them.  There are plenty of blog engines available, but this one is mine.  It's not super fancy, but it works well and I can change anything pretty easily.  Uses WYSIHTML5 for post authoring.
